                    As part of the Game Design I(MDDN221) course, we were required to create a 2D game. I(along with several other team members) created a 
                    2D Platformer called Knightpoint. I focused on Level Design and Programming in Blueprints while the rest did the art assets. We were
                    able to create 3 levels; while unable to incorporate everything in the Game Design Document, we trimmed unnecessary or secondary additions
                    to keep the basic structure of the game within the deadline we were given.

                        This was created to explore the possibility of moving user interface animations out of the animation tab and into code instead;
                        with the claim that using the Animator for User Interfaces is costly in terms of performance due to the fact that they apparently
                        update every frame. Currently only tweens between positions, but this could easily be extrapolated to work with any kind of values.
                        <br><br>
                        This was done using what's called <a href = "https://www.uml.edu/docs/Second-Theory_tcm18-190098.pdf">Second Order Systems</a>. I found it when 
                        someone used it to control the damping, response, and frequency
                        for <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPoeNZZ6H4s&t=14s&pp=ygUacHJvY2VkdXJhbCBhbmltYXRpb24gdW5pdHk%3D">Procedural Animations</a>. 
                        I adapted the method for User Interface animations and added extra components into the script, allowing 
                        animations to be triggered by buttons or to trigger other animations upon completion. This meant that animations could be tied together, 
                        where one finishes and then causes another to play.

                <p>This game was made for a Game Engine Programming class in which the task was to come to grips and 
                    make a game within a engine and showcase and talk about the code to show our understanding and profficiency
                    with said engine. I chose Godot for my engine and a platformer for my game, with only the most creative
                    title.

                        My most recent creation was a small prototype for a small game that was based around juggling
                        the flight patterns of airplanes so that they wouldn't crash into each other; having to redirect them
                        and hold certain ones in place while others can go. <b> Any relation in style or title to any games made by a development studio named after a prehistoric animal are entirely 
                            coincidental.
